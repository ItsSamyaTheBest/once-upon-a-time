Once upon a time there was a girl on her way to the store for her mother.
her mother wanted eggs, milk, flour, sugar, and chocolate for a cake shes baking for dessert that night.
The girl was so excited that she rushed to go the the stuff. 
But when she ran with the eggs they fell. 
She told her mom what happened, crying she was saying sorry that she ruined dessert. 
Her mom comforted her and told that it was ok and that we can make another dessert with the other stuff. 
So her and her mom baked together and had fun
